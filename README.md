Hi there! 👋 I'm **Gunel** (˶ᵔᗜᵔ˶)ﾉﾞ. For this project, I wanted to create a digital space that feels as "breezy" and aesthetic as a real vacation, while maintaining high technical standards for performance and responsiveness. (*ᵕᴗᵕ)⁾⁾

## 👩‍💻 Why I built this
Beyond just making things look pretty, I wanted to focus on **precision**. I spent a lot of time obsessing over how a layout should behave on high-end laptops vs. mobile phones. My goal was to create a seamless bridge between beautiful travel imagery and a functional, fast UI.

## ✨ What it can do
* **Intelligent Navigation:** The header isn't just sticky; it’s "smart." It transitions from transparent to solid as you scroll, ensuring the menu is always accessible without blocking the view.
* **TripAdvisor Integration:** I thought, "How can I make this useful?" So I linked every destination card directly to TripAdvisor. One click on the photo, and you're looking at real reviews and hidden gems.
* **MacBook Optimized:** I noticed layouts often clump in the center on larger screens, so I custom-tuned the breakpoints to ensure the content "breathes" perfectly on 13" and 14" displays.
* **Clean Aesthetics:** I used custom CSS transitions and hover effects to make the destination cards feel "interactive" and premium.

## 🛠 Technical Skills & Competencies

| **Category** | **Details** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Development** | **Modern HTML5 & Semantic Web:** I prioritize SEO-friendly structures to make sure the destinations are easy to find. <br> **Advanced CSS3:** I mastered **Flexbox** for this project to handle complex distribution of elements like the logo and nav-links. <br> **Retina-Ready Design:** I spent hours testing specific media queries to ensure the site looks crisp on high-DPI Mac displays. |
| **JavaScript & Logic** | **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** I used lightweight scripts for DOM Manipulation to handle the sticky header and mobile menu toggle. <br> **Performance over Bloat:** I chose not to use heavy libraries, keeping the site's "Time to Interactive" as low as possible. |

## 🧠 Technical Case Studies (How I solve problems)

> #### 1. Cross-Device UI Consistency
> **The Challenge:** Maintaining the "vibe" of the site when switching from a horizontal desktop view to a vertical mobile view.
> **My Solution:** I developed a mobile-first CSS architecture, ensuring that the package grid remains stable and the "Burger" menu provides an intuitive touch-screen experience.

> #### 2. Functional External Linking
> **The Challenge:** I wanted to avoid creating 10 different sub-pages for each city while still providing value.
> **My Solution:** I integrated a deep-linking system to **TripAdvisor**. By wrapping thumbnails in SEO-optimized anchors, I turned a simple landing page into a functional travel portal.
